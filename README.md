## Image to Dice Art
##### This project currently only works with .png filetypes and works best with images that are 1000x1000 pixels. The finished image will be cropped some, so keep the subject at the center of the image.

##### All .png images within the working directory will be used, but the original image will remain unaffected.

### Example with 1000x1000px image
This shows the source image, dice layout and the final product.
